      <h2>Preparations</h2>
        <h3>Scotia</h3>
          <p>In the autumn of 1901, Bruce purchased a Norwegian whaler, <em>Hekla</em>, at a cost of £2,620 (approximately £250,000 as of 2017). During the following months, the ship was completely rebuilt as an Antarctic research vessel, with two laboratories, a darkroom, and extensive specialist equipment. Two huge revolving cylinders, each carrying 6,000 fathoms (36,000 <abbr title="feets">ft</abbr>; 11,000 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>) of cable, were fitted to the deck to enable deep-sea trawling for marine specimens. Other equipment was installed for making depth soundings, for the collection of sea water and sea-bottom samples, and for meteorological and magnetic observations. The hull was massively reinforced to withstand the pressures of Antarctic ice, and the ship was re-rigged as a barque with auxiliary engines. This work increased the cost of the ship to £16,700 (approximately £1,640,000 as of 2017), which was met by the Coats family who altogether donated £30,000 towards the total expedition costs of £36,000. Renamed <i>Scotia</i>, the ship was ready for her sea trials in August 1902.</p>
        <h3>Personnel</h3>
          <p>The expedition's scientific staff consisted of six persons, including Bruce. The zoologist was David Wilton who, like Bruce, had been a member of the Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition. He had acquired skiing and sledging skills during several years living in northern Russia. Robert Rudmose-Brown, of University College, Dundee, and formerly an assistant in the Botany Department at the British Museum, was the party's botanist. Dr James Harvie Pirie, who had worked in the Challenger office under John Murray, was geologist, bacteriologist, and the expedition's medical officer. Robert Mossman directed meteorological and magnetic work, and Alastair Ross, a medical student, was taxidermist.</p>
          <p>Bruce appointed Thomas Robertson as <i>Scotia</i>'s captain. Robertson was an experienced Antarctic and Arctic sailor who had commanded the whaling ship Active on the Dundee Whaling Expedition. The rest of the 25 officers and men, who signed for three-year engagements, were all Scotsmen, many used to sailing in icy waters on whaling voyages.</p>
        <h3>Objectives</h3>
          <p>The objectives of the expedition were published in the <i class="journal">Scottish Geographical Magazine</i> and in the <abbr title="Royal Geographical Society">RGS</abbr> <i class="journal">Geographical Journal</i>, in October 1902. They included the establishment of a winter station "as near to the South Pole as is practicable", deep sea and other research of the Antarctic Ocean, and systematic observations and research of meteorology, geology, biology, topography and terrestrial physics. The essentially Scottish character of the expedition was expressed in <cite>The Scotsman</cite> shortly before departure: "The leader and all the scientific and nautical members of the expedition are Scots; the funds have been collected for the most part on this side of the Border; it is a product of voluntary effort, and unlike the expedition which will be simultaneously employed in the exploration of the Antarctic, it owes nothing to Government help".</p>
          <p>As the work of the expedition would be mainly at sea, or within the confines of the winter station, only a few dogs were taken, to facilitate the occasional sledge journey. Rudmose Brown records that of the original eight dogs, four survived the expedition; they "pulled well in harness, their only weak point being their paws which... were apt to be cut when on rough ice".</p>
